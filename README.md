If you compile the open source software that we make available from time to time to develop your own mobile, desktop or web application, and cause that application to connect to our servers for any purposes, we refer to that resulting application as an “Open Source App”. All Open Source Apps are subject to, and may only be used and/or commercialized in accordance with, the Terms of Use applicable to the Wire Application, which can be found at https://wire.com/legal/#terms. Additionally, if you choose to build an Open Source App, certain restrictions apply, as follows:

a. You agree not to change the way the Open Source App connects and interacts with our servers; b. You agree not to weaken any of the security features of the Open Source App; c. You agree not to use our servers to store data for purposes other than the intended and original functionality of the Open Source App; d. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any and all updates to your Open Source App.

For clarity, if you compile the open source software that we make available from time to time to develop your own mobile, desktop or web application, and do not cause that application to connect to our servers for any purposes, then that application will not be deemed an Open Source App and the foregoing will not apply to that application.

## Wire Desktop

Cross platform desktop app, wrapping the [wire-webapp](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp). Based on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git

### Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop.git
cd wire-desktop
yarn
```

### Start

### Other Linux targets or architectures

If you would like to build for another Linux target or architecture, run the following command:

```shell
grunt --arch=<arch> --target=<target> linux-other
```

Replace `<arch>` and `<target>` with your desired architecture (e.g. `"ia32"`) and target (e.g. `"rpm"`). Have a look at the [documentation for `electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options) for the available options. Note that we cannot offer support for uncommon architectures or targets.
